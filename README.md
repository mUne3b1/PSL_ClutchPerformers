## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `PSL_Season_09_dataset.csv`, which includes detailed ball-by-ball data of PSL Season 9. Key columns in the dataset:

- Grouped by match, innings, over, team, and player to calculate cumulative runs, balls faced, and wickets.
- Calculated strike rate for each player in death overs.

### Clutch Performers

- Identified top clutch performers in death overs by calculating total runs and strike rate.
- Highlighted top performers for each team using a performance score.

## Key Findings

- Top clutch performers in death overs were identified based on their ability to score runs at a high strike rate.
- A summary of the best performers for each team in death overs.

## Visualization

Visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to provide insights into the data:

1. **Average Runs Per Over in Death Overs by Team**
2. **Top Clutch Performers in Death Overs**
